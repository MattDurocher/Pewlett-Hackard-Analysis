# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
### Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to create tables with Bobby for his manager at Pewlett Hackard. The manager wants to have information on employees who are retiring while also having a birth date between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. We also wanted to find out which employees were eligble for mentorship while also being born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. In total, four tables were created and four csv files were created.
## Results
### Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Mentorship Eligibility
- There are 1549 eligible employees
- Each employee is listed once with their employee number, full name, hire date, retire date, birth date, and title.
- Hilari Morton is the first listed employee
- There are no columns with null or missing data

Retiring Titles
- There are seven groups of retiring employees
- The largest group retring is the "Senior Engineer" group
- The smallest group reitring is the "Manager" group
- All types of engineers take up three of the avaiable seven groups and make up 50.09% of all retiring employees
## Summary
### Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
