# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
### Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to create tables with Bobby for his manager at Pewlett Hackard. The manager wants to have information on employees who are retiring while also having a birth date between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. We also wanted to find out which employees were eligble for mentorship while also being born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. In total, four tables were created and four csv files were created.
## Results
